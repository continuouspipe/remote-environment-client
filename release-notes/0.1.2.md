## New Features

* Added `logs` command, check the available flags using `cp-remote logs --help`.

* Added `--dry-run` flag for watch, fetch and sync.

* Added `--rsync-verbose` flag in watch, fetch and push to help troubleshooting potential issues with ignore files.

* Allowing user to create a `.cp-remote-ignore-fetch` which will be included only when doing `fetch`. It allows the default `.cp-remote-ignore` file to be overridden.

## Bug Fixes

* Fix in `init` command - when an entire build is skipped due to filters the tide will now exit with an error instead of reporting sucess.

* Fix in `init` command - when a tide failed the process was hanging rather than exiting.

## Other Changes

* More descriptive error messages when the ContinuousPipe API does not respond or it fails to return the data.

* Printing version number at the top of the cp-remote log file.

* `watch` and `sync` commands won't delete files unless the flag `--delete` is set.
