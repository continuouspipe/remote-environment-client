Version: 0.1.0-beta.2

**New Features**

* Added `Init` command which initialises a remote environment using a token generated by the Continuous Pipe UI. If the initialization process is interrupted and restarted by default it will continue where it left, but you can use `--reset` to force it to start from the beginning.

* Added `Push` command which will sync files and folders to the remote container.

* In order to keep the cluster credentials secret, all communications to the cluster will go through the cp kubernetes proxy by default. You can still use a direct communication by editing the `.cp-remote-setting` and adding the cluster credentials.

* Allowing to override the remote path with `--remote-project-path`

**Bug Fixes:**

* Fixed the URL used in the update command as was pointing the wrong URL as it stopped working once the repository was made private.

* Fixed an issue that some user where experiencing when running the destroy and build commands in rapid succession.

**Other Changes:**

* The config has been split in 2, local and global. The global config is stored in the home directory `~/.cp-remote/config.yml` contains username, api-key and the urls for: cp-kube-proxy, cp-river-api address and cp-authenticator

* Replaced the flags `--project-key` and `--branch-name` with a single `--environment` flag as the 2 flags where always used as a pair to form the environment
